A generator is a just function that returns an iterable object
which we can iterate over (one value at a time)
Moreover, a generator function has one main difference from a regular function
It has a yield statement instead of a return statement in a regular function
To build an iterator in Python
you should do a lot of work
You have to implement a class with __iter__ and __next__ magic method, keep track of internal states and raise
StopIteration when there are no values to be returned
A generator is a very simple way to create an iterator
Because a generator does all of these steps automatically
